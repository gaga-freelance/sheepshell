# SheepShell

The Giantsheep front-end boilerplate and workflow

---

## Getting it working

* Install Gulp globally

/If you have installed Gulp previously then run this otherwise skip this step/
`$ npm rm --global gulp`

*Run this*
`$ npm install --global gulp-cli`

* Install all those lovely packages

`$ npm install`

* Run the thing

`$ gulp`

* That's it!

Your site should be serving at localhost:3000

*The default gulp task is running browserSync and watching for changes in the app directory*

### Other tasks

* Image optimisation

`$ gulp images`

This optimises images throughout. Takes bare time though!

*  Clean up the dist folder

`$ gulp clean:dist`

Because we don't like extra crap
